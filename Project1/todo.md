### npc visitors (players)
- npcs can die and lose their equipment
  - the lost equipment still exists in the world, maybe persistent enemies can steal it 
- npc equipment loses durability, when they break they come back to town to buy new
- npc chance to visit the town increases as:
  - their equipment loses durability or breaks, so they need to repair or buy new
  - their inventory fills up so they need to come back to sell
### off-map npc exploration
- create enemy entities. entities in general shouldn't necessarily have a graphics componentnecessarily, or a sprite/animation associated with it, because they can also simply live off-map to act as npc encounters
